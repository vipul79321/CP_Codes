Steps in Software development, i.e. to make ***.exe*** file: \
 1). **.cpp** file will be converted to **.i** file with help of **preprocessor**,  **.i** file will contain all header files expanded. \
 2). **.i** file will be converted to **.obj** file with help of **compiler**, **.obj** file will be in operating system language. \
 3). **.obj** file will be converted to **.exe** file with help of **linker**, **linker** will provide definition of library files in **.obj** file so that OS can fully understand it.
